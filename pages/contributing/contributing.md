Thanks for using NextBook! I hope you find this peace of software useful. 

If you want to contribute with documentation or [missing features](/wip-features), or if you have other ideas to implement, feel free to follow the basic **pull request routine** to contribute:

1. Open a bug report on Github [repository](https://github.com/amiroff/NextBook) page, 
2. Tell what feature you are willing to work on (to prevent duplicate efforts), 
3. Fork the repo,
4. Create your branch,
5. Implement your feature,
6. Commit && push,
7. Create a pull request.

Thanks for using NextBook!
