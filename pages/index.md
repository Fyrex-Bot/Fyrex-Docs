title: Create Lovely Documentation With MDX!
---

## Why NextBook?

I needed a usable, easy to use but fairly dynamic and good looking technical book/documentation creation tool. All available options like [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) while great tools themeselves (kudos to devs!), did not meet my needs. Some of them offered parts of these, but overall even payed ones could not offer the full package or were complex to get started quickly.

## Enter NextBook

NextBook is quick and easy way to buid technical books or documentation that support modern standards and run blazingly fast. It's built with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) and works by compiling markdown or MDX down to plain static html. This way, first content render on user's device is very fast, then hydration kicks in and React takes over to add dynamic stuff. The possibilities are endless.

NextBook makes writing technical docs stupid simple while keeping featureset minimal. Just creating markdown content files and updating table of contents should be enough to deploy a statically generated docs/book with the advantages of hybrid React app and even node API to do anything fancy (grading, level switching, you name it..) along the road. NextBook is not geared towards API documentation, rather it is optimised for tutorial/book style documentation. For API docs [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or plain [Spinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) would be a better fit.

## Primary Features

Main reasons to try **NextBook** on your next documentation project are:

- Good looking, simple, responsive and readable out of the box UI including `dark mode` via [HalfMoon](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/)
- Great SEO out of the box.
- A single page application with blazing speed via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Easy content creation with extensive [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) support.
- Something more than what basic fenced code offers. Like line highlighting and linking to source, copying to clipboard.
- Familiar [Git](https://github.com/) workflow and collaboration.
- Keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions.
- In-page dynamic table of contents with scroolspy.
- You own your data, code `is` the data. Committing to repository and seeing results in the simplest form.
